## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Combining absolute positioning with grid makes for more predictable and maintainable code!

### Continued development

More learning about CUBE CSS and CSS more generally. I'd like to learn more about responsive images.

### Useful resources

- [Position Absolute & Grid - Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdNG_PtuJXM) - This helped a lot in introducing use cases for `position: absolute` and Grid.
